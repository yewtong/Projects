Of course there is no perfect country, so there are always positive and negative sides. But my overall impression was a bit negative. (Especially after working at a Japanese company. Oh man)\n\nBut I noticed maybe I was wrong. There are so many nice things about Japan, like conbini (convenience stores). I think Japan might have the best conbini in the world.
