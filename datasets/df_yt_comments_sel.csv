And (3) because the bread tends to be folded over the block of ice cream like a taco shell, it kind of protects your hand from both the cold of the ice cream and it’s drippings.",8,,ice cream bread there’s also wafer option place bread—but preferences aside i’ve theorised bread option may came practical reasons 1 bread absorb melted ice cream ice cream melts really quickly thus minimising unintentional stains spills yourselfyour clothesthe floor etc 2 open packet bread retains texture mouthfeel bread longer open tin wafers preserves crunchy texture—partly less slices bread packet pieces wafer tin tend used quicker 3 bread tends folded block ice cream taco shell kind protects hand cold ice cream it’s drippings,GC

PROS & CONS OF LIVING IN SINGAPORE! 🇸🇬,TheInfinityDelta,3 years ago,"Well, I guess the tradeoff for having low taxes is the lack of an NHS. In fact, the government had discussed about this in the past and the prime minister then (LKY), he did not want the citizens to become reliant on government help as it would potentially breed laziness, complacency, and taking things for granted. Sort of like (oh, I don't have to take care of my own body and if I am sick, healthcare is free). This would have a bad economic impact on the country then, which was still developing, where if everyone falls sick/abuse the NHS system then productivity of companies would fall and so would revenue. The good part is that there are lots of social services around. An example would be the number of homeless citizens here. There are definitely homeless people here but it is very rare to find them due to the amount of social service we have here. Anyway, these social services or even the government would help, if they could, for those who really cannot afford healthcare. The subsidies provided by the government depends on the level of income as well (low income earners gets 80% subsidies on hospital wards and general bills).

Because of the nature of the rule, it is extremely hard to be prosecuted for this due to the fact that it is extremely hard to catch and arrest anyone that is having gay sex. There have been one or two people charged with it, but i don’t think there have been anyone that has actually been found guilty for this. The rule is actually quite loose, and used as a deterrent for any sort of male homosexual behaviour. Because people rarely actively seek out the terms and conditions of this law, they tend to stray away from any sort of homosexual behaviour due to fear of being arrested and charged.",2,View reply,238 circumstance implementation 377a penal code penetration male’s penis another male basically gay sex nature rule extremely hard prosecuted due fact extremely hard catch arrest anyone gay sex one two people charged don’t think anyone actually found guilty rule actually quite loose used deterrent sort male homosexual behaviour people rarely actively seek terms conditions law tend stray away sort homosexual behaviour due fear arrested charged,GC

Foreigners First Time In Geylang! 🇸🇬,Meifern Lee,1 year ago (edited),"The word Geylang is found early in Singapore's history and also in early topographical maps showing marsh and coconut plantations beside and adjacent to the mouth of the Kallang River, home to the Orang Laut (sea gypsies). One possible etymological link in the stock vocabulary of the Malay is 'geylanggan' meaning to 'twist' or 'crush' a reference to the process of extracting the coconut meat and milk used by the locals to thicken curries in Malay-Chinese (Peranakan) cuisine. The idea persists to this day, of the process of heartache and desperation associated with the broken and hurting lives of those involved in buying and selling of sex and drugs on the streets and in the registered brothel in the area. The word Geylang may be derived from a corrupted spelling of the Malay word 'gelang' which is a type of edible creeper (Portulaca oleracea). This is a more plausible explanation for the name because Malays typically name places based on the abundance of certain plant species (e.g. Melaka after the tree species of the same name) or geological formations (e.g. Bukit Gombak based on the comb-like hill summit.",14,View reply,word geylang found early singapore's history also early topographical maps showing marsh coconut plantations beside adjacent mouth kallang river home orang laut sea gypsies one possible etymological link stock vocabulary malay 'geylanggan' meaning 'twist' 'crush' reference process extracting coconut meat milk used locals thicken curries malaychinese peranakan cuisine idea persists day process heartache desperation associated broken hurting lives involved buying selling sex drugs streets registered brothel area word geylang may derived corrupted spelling malay word 'gelang' type edible creeper portulaca oleracea plausible explanation name malays typically name places based abundance certain plant species eg melaka tree species name geological formations eg bukit gombak based comblike hill summit,GC

The Truth About Why It's So Hard For Foreigners To Leave Singapore,David Ng,1 day ago,"I am bias for cooler weather because I associate it with vacations but my longest time away in cooler weather was just 6 weeks in Europe late summer/early fall and for 3 weeks during winters. I think what makes the European weather amazing is that you can sit on the grass outside and get some sun in summer without sweating. It encourages people to get out and be around nature and be active. In winter, the SAD from a lack of Vit D and isolation can be combated by meeting friends over a hot chocolate drink. It incentivizes meeting people and entering a restaurant, pub or even home is like a big warm hug that envelopes you. I think tropical people also have reason to romanticize seasonal weather because like changing curtains or rearranging furniture, the weather changes seasonally to keep things fresh. By the time you get bored of the current weather, a new season arrives and with it comes its foods, activities and colours that force you to adapt to it.",2,,bias cooler weather associate vacations longest time away cooler weather 6 weeks europe late summerearly fall 3 weeks winters think makes european weather amazing sit grass outside get sun summer without sweating encourages people get around nature active winter sad lack vit isolation combated meeting friends hot chocolate drink incentivizes meeting people entering restaurant pub even home big warm hug envelopes think tropical people also reason romanticize seasonal weather changing curtains rearranging furniture weather changes seasonally keep things fresh time get bored current weather new season arrives comes foods activities colours force adapt,GC

Interesting fact of Kampong glam: (from culture trip website) 
The history of Kampong Glam can be traced back to the 1820s when it was first named. The name comes from the Malay language where kampung means ‘village’ and ‘gelam’ was a type of tree known as the Paperbark tree that grew in the area and was frequently used for building ships. For a long time, Kampong Glam was a fishing village due to its location on the Rochor River. In 1820s, Sir Stamford Raffles designated the Kampong Glam as well as an annual stipend to Sultan Hussain Mohammed Shah for use by the Muslim community after he signed a treaty ceding Singapore to the East India Company.",10,,arabica coffee japanese cafe coffees goooddd imo interesting fact kampong glam culture trip website history kampong glam traced back 1820s first named name comes malay language kampung means ‘village’ ‘gelam’ type tree known paperbark tree grew area frequently used building ships long time kampong glam fishing village due location rochor river 1820s sir stamford raffles designated kampong glam well annual stipend sultan hussain mohammed shah use muslim community signed treaty ceding east india company,GC

Japanese Reacting to Chinese New Year in Singapore,David Tai Wai Leong,8 months ago,"Hahaha! Thanks Ghib, for sharing this vlog! This really suits the festivities now! 😄😄  About the Yu Sheng, it is indeed from Singapore- a dish invented by 4 Cantonese chefs who wanted to create something that uses simple everyday ingredients in a novel way that celebrates the CNY. Now about the phrases, you’d have to maybe be a Cantonese to enjoy the deeper meanings; besides the auspicious phrases used to describe each ingredient- sometimes with a play of words and as a wish to the business man customers dining at the restaurant (after which the diners will typically tip the waitress) it was served with raw fish slices- the phrase which was 年年有餘 (Having abundance every year) while placing the fish over the ingredients (as 年年有魚)- “Having “Fish” every year”. But the call out was not “Huat” before; it’s “Loh-ah” (捞啊!) which means (getting into business/doing well in business/working hard for business- generally speaking) but it also means “to Mix” in Cantonese; the act of mixing up the ingredients to its final for-consumption stage. The “Huat-ah!” came about because we are culturally diverse and being a majority of Hokkien dialect in Singapore evolves into “Huat-ah!” In Cantonese families, we still use “Loh-ah!” for example. The spillage is not an intended practice as you may be able to imagine how the prim and proper business man in the 60’s would’ve behaved in such a dinner setting. But the consumption of this auspicious dish quickly spread to many many families, in restaurants, in coffee shops and of course the homes. And when this is done in families with little ones or among a group of rowdy friends, squeezed for space to get in on the auspicious action of “Loh-ing” for good luck and prosperity, this do get out of hand- no pun intended. Whilst this practice originated as Cantonese’s, very soon Teochew have their very own style of ingredients used and the type of fish used. But since the ban of raw fish a few years ago, its been down to abalone strips or salmon...which in my opinion, is less tasty now. This practice of course was practiced in Malaysia very quickly because of the huge base of Cantonese there. But surprisingly, the largest base of Cantonese in HK or Guangzhou has only very recently done this.",11,View 4 replies from Ghib Ojisan and others,hahaha thanks ghib sharing vlog really suits festivities yu sheng indeed dish invented 4 cantonese chefs wanted create something uses simple everyday ingredients novel way celebrates cny phrases you’d maybe cantonese enjoy deeper meanings besides auspicious phrases used describe ingredient sometimes play words wish business man customers dining restaurant diners typically tip waitress served raw fish slices phrase abundance every year placing fish ingredients “having “fish” every year” call “huat” it’s “lohah” means getting businessdoing well businessworking hard business generally speaking also means “to mix” cantonese act mixing ingredients final forconsumption stage “huatah” came culturally diverse majority hokkien dialect evolves “huatah” cantonese families still use “lohah” example spillage intended practice may able imagine prim proper business man 60’s would’ve behaved dinner setting consumption auspicious dish quickly spread many many families restaurants coffee shops course homes done families little ones among group rowdy friends squeezed space get auspicious action “lohing” good luck prosperity get hand pun intended whilst practice originated cantonese’s soon teochew style ingredients used type fish used since ban raw fish years ago abalone strips salmonwhich opinion less tasty practice course practiced malaysia quickly huge base cantonese surprisingly largest base cantonese hk guangzhou recently done,GO

Maybe I Shouldn't Buy a House in Singapore,Two Claps,2 months ago,"Hello, just want to share my experience and thoughts on your idea of home ownership in Singapore. I always believe your first property should always be a property of purpose, not investment. if it serves your purpose and your parthners, its will be the best buy the two of you will appreciate. If the value of your purposeful property increase, its a bonus. if it doesn't, it has served you well nonetheless. On your mother-in-laws perspective on her HDB and how she can make 2 times the profit. To be honest, her flat would most likely be mostly paid in CPF funds. which means when she sells it, most of the profits will return to CPF as well. And the compounded interest when she used her CPF to buy her HDB will be compounded on a 2.6% per year. If i would make a calculated guess, she bought her flat at 160,000SGD, that would be roughly 20 to 25 years ago? so after the interest that she has to pay back cpf and the profits that has to be returned to cpf base on how many percentage of cpf she used to pay her flat. how much cash can she profit? and even if she does liquidate her flat, where is she going to stay? to buy back the the same flat at the same town she stays, is there still going to be a profit at all? so technically, your mother in laws flat is a purpose property. she has to have a place to stay. So in short, investing in Singapore for a HDB flat is most likely for a purpose, not so much an investment. maybe after your HDB purchase down the road, u can consider getting a place in Japan as an investment property. and then its purely for speculation and for investment. hope this helps you make a decision!",77,View 3 replies,hello want share experience thoughts idea home ownership always believe first property always property purpose investment serves purpose parthners best buy two appreciate value purposeful property increase bonus served well nonetheless motherinlaws perspective hdb make 2 times profit honest flat would likely mostly paid cpf funds means sells profits return cpf well compounded interest used cpf buy hdb compounded 26 per year would make calculated guess bought flat 160000sgd would roughly 20 25 years ago interest pay back cpf profits returned cpf base many percentage cpf used pay flat much cash profit even liquidate flat going stay buy back flat town stays still going profit technically mother laws flat purpose property place stay short investing hdb flat likely purpose much investment maybe hdb purchase road u consider getting place japan investment property purely speculation investment hope helps make decision,GO

Although the cinema has been closed for a long time, the area had always been bustling up till 2017, when it was announced that the area would be closed down, and the land used to build an extension of the woodlands check. It was due to this initiative that stalls were closed down, and even the hawker centre was moved to the new marsiling mall. So I would hope that it could be clarified, that the area and this so called “ghost town” was never “abandoned” but was being closed to carry out new plans.",5,View reply,gjib ojisan appreciate someone exploring somewhere outside city central seems wrong call old woodlands central ghost town although cinema closed long time area always bustling till 2017 announced area would closed land used build extension woodlands check due initiative stalls closed even hawker centre moved new marsiling mall would hope could clarified area called “ghost town” never “abandoned” closed carry new plans,GO

My Social Studies teacher actually talked about Singapore's state right now. Due to the Covid-19, there are fewer foreigners coming to Singapore. This led to many discounts on for locals for several attractions (hence the 50% discount and if I'm not wrong, there are discounts for USS as well). This is to attract the locals to spend, keeping SG's economy from falling. Basically if there aren't foreigners to spend money in SG, SGeans have to spend theirs (to support the economy).

Singapore is not that expensive a country as many foreigners think. It all depends on where in Singapore you are.

I visited Singapore in 2018 expecting prices to be way higher in Canada, but really they are about the same, with hawker centre food being way cheaper than in Canada. I don't think Singapore deserves to be in the World's most expensive city spot. It is quite affordable. Public transport is also very cheap. In Canada, it is 2-3 times higher. Hotel accommodation is also slightly cheaper and much better too for the price you pay. Singaporeans have much to be grateful for but I hear from my friend there that many complain a lot and think the grass is greener overseas. It really is not.",19,,another great video yesyou right smarter lot foreignersjust think took time travel less know areas expensive country many foreigners think depends food cheap hawker centres stuff clothing outlying areas visited 2018 expecting prices way higher canada really hawker centre food way cheaper canada think deserves world's expensive city spot quite affordable public transport also cheap canada 23 times higher hotel accommodation also slightly cheaper much better price pay singaporeans much grateful hear friend many complain lot think grass greener overseas really,GO

Japanese Searching for Flaws at Singapore's TOP Polytechnic | Ngee Ann Poly,Ahlora Chew,8 months ago (edited),"In Singapore, after you graduate Secondary school, and get either N Level or O Level certificate, majority of the students get to choose whether you want to take a diploma or an A Level certificate. If you want to specify in a specific field, then a diploma in that field is what they take, and the polytechnics provide this. Polytechnics and ITEs (which is another choice you can go to) focus more on vocational and work skills. That is why the school campus is so big, because in Ngee Ann alone, it is split into (if I'm not wrong), 9 schools. Each school teaching different fields. Eg, Technology, Film, Art, Engineering, Business, Sciences. There are internal shuttle buses to move within the school easier. Many of the teachers too come from the actual industries that they are teaching about.",129,,graduate secondary school get either n level level certificate majority students get choose whether want take diploma level certificate want specify specific field diploma field take polytechnics provide polytechnics ites another choice go focus vocational work skills school campus big ngee ann alone split i'm wrong 9 schools school teaching different fields eg technology film art engineering business sciences internal shuttle buses move within school easier many teachers come actual industries teaching,GO

My Honest Thoughts on Living in Singapore for 1 Year,佐々木絵里,7 months ago,"I agree with the people here having bad manners like the MRT example, and also the toilet cleanliness is incomparable to Japan even thou we have cleaners stationed at the toilets. Because of the way our education works,  many parents emphasize a lot into academic  but not on moral educations. That is why there is this ""high self-entitlement"" status in Singapore, like what you have talk about the ""selfishness"". Additional to that, SG population is well-mixed with foreigners so it is pretty hard to point fingers at who are the problematic ones. So most of the time I use the phrase ""people living here"" rather than Singaporeans. I find your videos very down to earth and accurate.

My Honest Thoughts on Living in Singapore for 1 Year,Taufiq AR,7 months ago,"Hey Ghib love your videos! Here are some things i would say about japan too: during rush hours in tokyo its almost impossible to board a train. You will be pushed and even stepped on. The person won't even look at you and say sorry. Because it became like a norm. But i feel thats double standard - for a country thats supposed to be so polite, why would you do that and not even say 'excuse me' or sorry. Secondly lets not forget about ""Chikans"".. Japan is probably the only country where molestation rate is so high that separate 'women only' train carts had to be introduced.. and to make the matters worse, most of the victims just secretly gets molested without raising any voice. Such case in singapore is very rare. Thirdly, when an elderly comes in the train or bus, most people give up their seats in Singapore. It never happens in Japan unless its a special seat. You talked about Japan being clean - i used to think that too but If you go to the back  ally of Shibiya, Shinjuku, Ebisu you will see how crazy it is. Unlike singapore japan doesn't have any trash bins and they expect everyone to carry their own trash. Well many people (especially young ones) doesn't want to do that, so they trash the street and sidewalks. In singapore you don't see it often. And i dont think people are afraid to get a fine, its just that the trash bins are everywhere. You talked about the weather - Japan isnt always cold ..you have summer and also other pleasant seasons when the temperature is just nice. So there is a variety. In singapore its always summer every day of the year ..if you live here for 10 years you may start to miss winter again.  You are right about Conbini and super having good professional service, but then again most frontline staff in Singapore are not really Singaporeans due to pay being low and cost of living being high. In Japan even though there are some foreigners in frontline recently, majority i believe are still Japanese. I feel most Japanese people  don't know how to express themselves well, or say no or have a voice of their own. So they cant really speak their mind which is why they are sometimes following rules blindly. I feel its not very good and needs to change. Frankly you have been very nice about Singaporeans in your video. i think the culture here is unique just like how it is in Japan.",63,,hey ghib videos things would say japan rush hours tokyo almost impossible board train pushed even stepped person even look say sorry became norm feel thats double standard country thats supposed polite would even say 'excuse me' sorry secondly lets forget chikans japan probably country molestation rate high separate 'women only' train carts introduced make matters worse victims secretly gets molested without raising voice case rare thirdly elderly comes train bus people give seats never happens japan unless special seat talked japan clean used think go back ally shibiya shinjuku ebisu see crazy unlike japan trash bins expect everyone carry trash well many people especially young ones want trash street sidewalks see often dont think people afraid get fine trash bins everywhere talked weather japan isnt always cold summer also pleasant seasons temperature nice variety always summer every day year live 10 years may start miss winter right conbini super good professional service frontline staff really singaporeans due pay low cost living high japan even though foreigners frontline recently majority believe still japanese feel japanese people know express well say voice cant really speak mind sometimes following rules blindly feel good needs change frankly nice singaporeans video think culture unique japan,GO

Then those that don;t even say thank you to you for holding the lift door open for them, instead they take their own sweet time to walk to the lift. So fed up with their sense of entitlement, I stop being kind to such idiots. It is also the very reason why some shop assistants don't greet people anymore esp Singaporeans because some among us don't respond ( I'm sure a smile will suffice even if you don't feel like greeting back!). Also while this conoravirus has made some Singaporeans mask themselves when they are sick, I'm sure once this is over, they will continue to cough into the air and spread their flu to innocent persons.
