    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "In a world still battling the spread of Covid-19, countries around the world have shut down their borders. In the wake of a devastating loss in tourism dollars, government bodies and organisations announced the launch of the SingapoRediscovers campaign on 22nd July 2020 and set aside 45 million dollars to boost domestic tourism. However, a new initiative in the form of SingapoRediscovers vouchers was announced less than a month later. This new initiative comes with a budget of 320 million dollars and aim to distribute $100 vouchers to all Singaporeans aged 18 and above valid for seven months from December 2020 to end-June 2021.\n",
    "\n",
    "With so much stimulus dollars planned to revive our hardest-hit industry, just what exactly is domestic tourism? If you give it further thought, it is a concept that appears paradoxical - can you still be a tourist back home? But, if you were to ask around, it seems most everyone has an idea on what domestic tourism is. As soon as word about the $100 vouchers started circulating, it seems everyone began planning their next staycation or a trip to the USS. Is that all there is to domestic tourism, or is there more?\n",
    "\n",
    "Representing STB, my project aims to uncover Singaporeans' perception of domestic tourism, and to predict where the $100 vouchers would most likely go.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project hypothesises ... methodology? singaporeans do not think of domestic tourism as tourism, rather just activities they would be interested in doing. but they do understand what tourism is, as can be seen from their recommendations....\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this, my project hopes to gather enough insight to understand who would most likely benefit from these stimulus dollars, and to propose recommendations on the next phase of campaigns."
