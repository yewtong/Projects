I found them a little robotic at times, though in some ways I think I admired what came across as the constant discipline. On the plus side of this, yes it is fantastically safe. We had an amah, but the way I looked at it was she needed the employment, she could have had it worse and she knew it. It beats not appreciating that and well, turfing them out to do whatever. I've watched a lot of your videos now, was very taken aback how mosquitos seemed to like you when you first got there, maybe still do? I never had a big issue with them there. For culture I'd cover religion there, best to take a local with you who understands what's going on and can guide you on the etiquette, but the Temples on Sin Ming drive, Ang Mo Kio are well worth covering I think, though they are very much working temples, funerals, offerings to God's, the lot is going on there but worth visiting whilst you're there I think.

If u r single, u can only purchase it when u hit 35. Unless, that singaporean is rich, he/she can move out and purchase a house early provided that it is a private housing or a resale HDB. In a nutshell, the average singaporean still lives with their parents because housing in singapore is crazy expensive from 3 room HDB ranging at $250,000-$350,000.

Singaporeans aren't the friendliest bunch and can be a tad xenophobic but it's so nice to see people trying to understand the culture here. I work with expats and sometimes hear their frustrations at how their co-workers barely invite them into their lives but it definitely takes two hands to clap and great to see that your colleagues have been welcoming. I've watched your videos since you moved to Singapore and you've grown tremendously. However long you are still in Singapore, I just thought you should know from a Singaporean that you've been very kind to this sometimes-brutal country and I hope the people you've met have extended that hospitality to you. xx",171,

Reading Your Assumptions About Brits + Life In The UK! 🇬🇧,Cici Heart,5 months ago,In my experience about the complaining that both Brits and Singaporeans can complain a lot but with Brits (as well as Dutch people like me) you Will notice it sooner because they make it very clear. With Singaporeans it often is more an ‘internal complaint’ because culturally it is not done to voice your negative opinions out loud.

9 Bizarre Things Singaporeans Do That Foreigners Don’t Understand!,Kuma-kun,3 months ago (edited),"About ice cream in bread: there’s also a wafer option (in place of bread)—but preferences aside, I’ve theorised that the bread option may have came about for a few practical reasons; (1) bread can absorb melted ice cream (and ice cream melts really quickly here), thus minimising unintentional stains or spills on yourself/your clothes/the floor, etc. (2) an open packet of bread retains the texture and mouth-feel of bread longer than an open tin of wafers preserves its crunchy texture—partly because there are less slices of bread in a packet than there are pieces of wafer in a tin, so they tend to be used up quicker. And (3) because the bread tends to be folded over the block of ice cream like a taco shell, it kind of protects your hand from both the cold of the ice cream and it’s drippings.",8,

Each gantry has a camera that will take the picture of the rear number plate when it detects a non payment or a insufficent value in the card. Singapore is very efficient in taking people's money.

TRAVEL TO PENANG! 🇲🇾 THINGS TO DO IN GEORGETOWN,Stephen Vincent,11 months ago,We were last in Georgetown seven years ago when much of the street art was quite new. It appears the whole place has deteriorated markedly since then. I had expected to see much more renewal and renovation however it seems the opposite has occurred. Did you enjoy the aroma from the drains? Not something easily forgotten in that stifling heat. Glad you both enjoyed your time there. The Peranakan mansion/museum sure was spectacular wasn’t it? We think today’s wealthy live well but they did pretty well back then also.,2,View reply from Georgia Caney

Is Our Future In Singapore? 👀 Answering Your Questions About Us! Q&A,Miss Sophie,10 months ago,"When you asked the question on Brexit, I was full of trepidation. I'm Singaporean, married to a Brit and have two children. There are so many people I know who have a lot of nasty words to say to those who wish to leave - ""You have no idea what is going on. You are stupid/ignorant. Only old people want to leave. You are not thinking of your children's future"" So it's really refreshing to hear from the two of you how you feel about it and that some young people actually bother to research on the EU and reach their own conclusions on Brexit (rather than just supporting what others say). Or things have come to such a state when it's actually better for the UK to leave. Well, that being said, I'm not British so my views actually do not matter.

DAY IN THE LIFE OF AN ENGINEER WORKING IN SINGAPORE: Q&A + WORKING ON SITE,Jacci Hall,1 year ago,Hello Justin honestly i like someone like u who really take a huge PRIDE in your job. To be seriously honest mostly people they work because they NEEDED money but not because they like the job! Just like some of my friends especially those who work as sales assistants they really HATED their jobs cause working as sales assistants u need to work long hours some work from 10 am to 10 pm but because they needed money so they FORCED themselves to work. Yes i admit sales assistant earns much more than me an office girl. I work from 9 am to 6 pm mondays to fridays. My friends those who work as sales assistants work long hours and have to work on public holidays and weekends. I really really hope that your video have encourage people like my friends who hated their jobs will learn from u on how to enjoy love their jobs and take pride in their jobs. At least they have a job rather than being jobless and depend on people for a living!,44,View 3 replies

DAY IN THE LIFE OF AN ENGINEER WORKING IN SINGAPORE: Q&A + WORKING ON SITE,Farhan Suhaimi,1 year ago,Test pile is used to confirm that the design parameters used are acceptable. Design parameters are first assumed based on past established values and exploratory soil borelogs but need to be confirmed with such tests cos soil is very variable. Piles do improve the ground to a certain extent but the primary way they are used is to bring the vertical load from columns down to a competent layer eg rock to minimise future settlement. Test piles are typically abandoned after testing to 3x working load ie they will not be used to support the permanent structure. Typically you wait 28 days for the concrete to reach its design strength before testing. Cheers 😊,3,CLAIM NOW!

‘WEIRD’ THINGS SINGAPOREANS DO THAT BRITS DON’T UNDERSTAND,Shani de Wit,2 years ago,"Hey Georgia, enjoyed this video!

I just hate if someone has to ask me if they can have the seat because I did not notice them standing there, I feel like I was being rude not to offer it even though I didn't even see them. Also, I think it's a Singaporean thing to not mind standing in public transport; whenever I take the bus in the European city I live, if there are some seats free but they are all next to strangers, I don't mind just standing. Also I constantly get called out in my (non-Singaporean) friend group for not wanting to share utensils (because they don't mind and so they get a bit offended), and that's something I feel I adopted from Singaporean culture to be honest.

I would like to share with you my awkward MRT story. 
There was once I sat on the priority seat and dozed off. Shortly after that I got a knock on my forehead and I was so shocked to see an elderly man glaring at me when I opened my eyes! This elderly person asked me aloud:“ Do you know the priority seat is meant for the elderly? Are you the elderly?"" Since there were many empty seats beside me, I shifted a few spaces from the priority seat. However, he kept talking loudly to other nearby passengers about how youngsters have no manners nowadays, and how young people from his times had to bow their heads 90 degrees down to greet the elderly. I tried to ignore him, but It was so awkward that when I reached my stop I scurried off asap... THE END",,CLAIM NOW!

What I've Learned Living In Singapore For 3 Years,Lionell Hwang,1 year ago,"To be fair to taxi drivers, they will always ask you for directions even if they know their way.

What I've Learned Living In Singapore For 3 Years,Paul Stiles,1 year ago,"I’m glad you are enjoying living in Singapore Georgia, I normally visit Singapore once a year to visit family, because my Mother was born in Singapore. The amount of things to see & do there is incredible & it’s so easy to get from one place to another, the public transport is first class in Singapore, I love going on the MRT & enjoy going to Sentosa Island. One dislike I have with Singapore is so crowded!, especially at shopping malls & in the MRT, it seems every time I visit Singapore it gets more crowded. Also the amount of plastic bags in Supermarkets, even when your only getting one or two items they put it in a plastic bag for you, where I live in Australia, there are no plastic bags anywhere anymore. And I hate when there is a thunderstorm in Singapore, because I’m really scared of the thunder, I know I am a bit of a chicken at times! 😛",10,View reply from Georgia Caney
What I've Learned Living In Singapore For 3 Years,Kopi O Kaya,1 year ago (edited),"Cold Storage is outright slaughter and daylight robbery. Fairprice is not cheap either. Try Sheng Siong or local wet markets. Quality of food is much better too.

Hope you have enjoyed your time here. It's true that in order to enjoy the country, you need to know the people and their cultures to appreciate the country's uniqueness, be it good or bad. It is the software that makes the country, not just the hardware, and a true judgement of the country is its people who either give a guest   a good or bad impression that will make them want to come bad or not.

That was how I remembered him explaining it, and why Cold Storage is the most expensive.

When I first heard people use it I was honestly confused but now I use it too lol. The way I see it, it’s just a really abbreviated way to say one isexhausted as if one had just shagged (british definition). This word also got gradually shortened from shagged to shag at some pointed I feel, just from memory. Some people people even spell it as “shack”, like what?

If they don’t do that, Singapore will be like its neighbouring countries cities for  example Bangkok, Jakarta and Kuala Lumpur whereby traffic jams is like a norm which last for hrssssss and getting a cup of coffee and some groceries which is like only 3 blocks away will take you eternity to reach. Like what Justin says Singapore is a city state and like any other cities....you don’t need a car to travel as public transport is super accessible and very cheap too compared to other countries.Having a car in Singapore is not a necessity but more of a commodity.",19,DOWNLOAD

PROS & CONS OF LIVING IN SINGAPORE! 🇸🇬,TheInfinityDelta,3 years ago,"Well, I guess the tradeoff for having low taxes is the lack of an NHS. In fact, the government had discussed about this in the past and the prime minister then (LKY), he did not want the citizens to become reliant on government help as it would potentially breed laziness, complacency, and taking things for granted. Sort of like (oh, I don't have to take care of my own body and if I am sick, healthcare is free). This would have a bad economic impact on the country then, which was still developing, where if everyone falls sick/abuse the NHS system then productivity of companies would fall and so would revenue. The good part is that there are lots of social services around. An example would be the number of homeless citizens here. There are definitely homeless people here but it is very rare to find them due to the amount of social service we have here. Anyway, these social services or even the government would help, if they could, for those who really cannot afford healthcare. The subsidies provided by the government depends on the level of income as well (low income earners gets 80% subsidies on hospital wards and general bills). I guess this reduces the number of people who plans to live off others (the govt lol).",43,View 18 replies from Georgia Caney and others

PROS & CONS OF LIVING IN SINGAPORE! 🇸🇬,Raphael Nation,2 years ago (edited),You are allowed 21 Sick days in the USA and you are encouraged to take them and you don’t need a doctor’s note because it hurts productivity if you come to work sick and spread the flu virus say. And if you don’t use all your sick days at the end of the year you can convert half of the remaining days to cash and receive a bonus. This is better than MCs in Singapore or the UK. I left in SG in 2012 because the conditions of work were worse than I had in the USA.,12,View 6 replies from Georgia Caney and others

PROS & CONS OF LIVING IN SINGAPORE! 🇸🇬,Nurul Natasha,2 years ago (edited),born and raised in singapore and i agree completely! great to hear your point of view. sometimes singaporeans live in a cage and we think other parts of the world are working long hours as us so why complain but it seems like there definitely is a need for changes like work life balance. i do feel it personally and it can get depressing that we singaporeans spent most of our time at work and simply is lacking in the 'life department. can you perhaps do a 'pros and cons of UK' next? would love to see the areas we can improve on and personally am thinking of moving there for a bit.,42,

Our Roommate Horror Stories! 🤢 Spilling The Tea!,Ranger629,1 year ago (edited),"Yeah, I feel you on Singapore horror landlords. They are literally people who think way too highly of themselves but at the same time, they are ""broke"" so they will try to dig their ways to get money out of their tenants. The lady who didn't want anything done to her house, she's what we call ""rich but poor"". She bought the house gambling that the price will increase, but she doesn't have enough cash on her hand so she can't afford to let it sit there and do nothing. So they rent their house out, but once you have people living in the house the value will drop because of the renovations required as compared to ""brand new"" houses within the same vicinity. They will always demand their tenants to abide by ridiculous rules, avoid those landlords all in all. Let them learn it the hard way that if they want to do property investment without money, don't push the blame onto the tenants simply because they made a mistake.",21,View reply from Georgia Caney

TRYING TO PRONOUNCE SINGAPORE MRT STATIONS!,Kok-Yong Tan,3 years ago (edited),"90% bang on.  Very impressive.  From an old codger Singaporean who's older than Singapore is a nation!  Just remember that we pronounce most things ""British-style"" and not ""American-style"" due to our colonial past:  'a' is mostly pronounced as ""ah"", not the American ""ay""; 'i' is mostly pronounced as ""ee"" instead of the American ""aye""; 'u' is mostly pronounced as ""oo"" and not ""you"".  ""Khatib"" is an exception to this and Justin got it right the first time (""car tib"").  ""Sembawang"" is ""sem bah wahng"".  ""Choa Chu Kang"" is ""choo-ah choo kahng"" (dashes mean the sounds flow into each other to create a single syllable, while absence of dashes mean each sound is a separately distinct syllable).  ""Toa Payoh"" is ""tu-ah pie yo"".  ""Kembangan"" is ""kem barhng an"".  ""Yio Chu Kang"" is ""yeo choo kahng"".  And ""Yishun"" is ""yee shoon"".

I used to work with foreign chefs and once I was asked if I liked working with local or foreign ones, I prefer the latter. THEY are brutally honest, compared with local ones who would hint and hint instead of telling me straight up what I did wrong. ",65,

N yes, standing on the left of the escalator is supposed to be the correct side. It just makes more sense. In the UK and Singapore we all keep to the left side of the road when driving cars. Why shouldn't it be the same for escalators? If the left side is used for driving n the right is for escalator, people who are tired can get confused on the roads.

MY THOUGHTS ON BEING CALLED ANG MOH! | SINGAPORE EXPAT Q&A,Peter Pan,2 years ago,"I think Ang Moh is not necessarily derogatory nor is it categorizing all white people as one race. It could be seen as a singlish substitute for ""Caucasian"" or when we refer to white-people in general. It is similar to how Westerners will use ""Asian"" to describe people with yellow/brown skin with black hair, which doesn't really mean they are being disrespectful or ignorant for categorizing all Asian as one race. That being said, I understand why you would feel that it is derogatory if people were to say ""stupid ang moh"", as I think it would sound equally disrespectful if someone were to call us ""stupid Asian"".",101,

I think it's about the third video of yours that I'm watching with the makeup/glasses free apologetic intro. You really shouldn't - and I'm saying this as a 26 y.o. guy. I think that the verb ""painting face"" sums up how funny the concept of this action can be, as if it's a paint to put on the refrigerator door. You're a good looking woman (no subliminal messages here, just stating the facts), and you can do no wrong without it - there's nothing to hide.

MY THOUGHTS ON BEING CALLED ANG MOH! | SINGAPORE EXPAT Q&A,ccheriee,2 years ago,"I understand it can be frustrating when you see the term 'angmoh' used in a derogatory manner, and surely that would lead to the apprehension of the term itself. However, like many people have pointed out, the word 'angmoh' is literally just another Singlish term that's used very often in Singapore, in this case, to refer to a caucasian person. Any word can be used in a nice manner and a derogatory manner. If you read someone making the following comment: ""Wa this stupid angmoh come here and steal our job, go away la"" it certainly doesn't feel good. But you can easily switch the term angmoh with caucasian like ""wa this stupid caucasian come here and steal our job, go away la"" and essentially there's no difference. It's just that we won't actually bother with using the word caucasian just like how we'd say 'jialat' over 'terrible', 'cheem' over 'difficult, or 'lobang' over 'a good opportunity/deal'.",,View reply from Georgia Caney

I mean, if your ear isn't that sensitive and heals relatively well, I would recommend you just get it done at any place that uses the guns. Those at Far East uses the needles and requires skills thats why it costs a whole lot more. The one in cine is like $3-4 per piercing and I haven't had any problems with mine!

People there still purchase their plastic bags in rolls of 50 for their trash bins at home, while in comparison Singaporeans re-use supermarket plastic bags as trash bags.

My reverse culture shock was the way Singaporean would complain on things that I felt was trivial or took a lot of things for granted as compared to living in Manila.  Example: Traffic in Singapore is nothing compared to Manila. Driving in Singapore vs driving in Manila. Utilities like water and power outages. I didn't have piped water supply and depended on my water tank being refilled every Wednesday.  Power outage was so normal, my house was filled with battery powered devices and loads of candles. But I wouldn't change it for anything coz it thought me patience and being grateful for the things I had back in Singapore.

I was born and raised in Singapore but have spent the past seven years in Japan; I REALLY felt you when you talked about the groceries and produce, except in reverse lol because YES! Produce is so expensive in Singapore! (And not very fresh!) I really felt it when I had to buy some vegetables to cook for my parents during one of my visits back home. The recycling thing is true, so true; here in Japan we have a really solid system that stressed me out when I first came (burnable refuse on Tuesdays and Friday for my district, and every Wednesday it's a different sort of refuse - plastic bottles, non-burnables, cans, glass bottles, in that order for the month; things like that) until I found out that every supermarket has huge recycle bins that allow you to bring your (washed and dried) refuse to sort and recycle. I can even drop used batteries there. I really like it. There is still a lot of plastic use, however, but people are a lot more aware about how it impacts the environment, and I find that there are a lot more people who genuinely want to make a difference about reducing the use of plastic. :) Thanks for sharing this!",,View reply from Georgia Caney

Just because you limit plastic bag use in major markets, doesn't mean that you can't buy trash bags for home use. AND the idea is that when you pay or get limited amounts of plastic bags (as opposed to being too easily accessible or unlimited) you become more conscious of their use and perhaps use them much more efficiently. Instead on throwing out my trash half-full, I would throw my trash when it's full. I might get started on composting or not cook too much and throw food away because I realise it's the food scraps that become really smelly. Etc etc.",,

MY FAVOURITE SINGAPORE SNACKS! 🇸🇬,daphn3t,2 years ago,"hey georgia! i really enjoyed watching your videos! i used to binge watch youtubers review foreign snacks or foods in general, so its refreshing to hear a foreigner review foods that i grew up eating! btw the want want snack is called ""hei bai pei"" (hey-bye-pay), and want want, or we singaporeans call it, ""wang wang"", is the brand of the snack. wang wang used to make some sort of milk drink in a can too, i remember my brother used to love it as a child. i don't see it around as much nowadays, but you can try your luck and find them hawker centre drink stalls. now that I've thought about it, wang wang makes some of my favourite childhood snacks! they have some salted biscuits and those little wafer balls, you should try them one day! hehe i love my hei bai pei wafer sticks the most, they're just the best! please do more videos on singaporean foods, they're so entertaining to watch! love you xoxo",,

Groceries are cheaper but you should go to Aldi and Lidl. You will find them even cheaper. 19p for cauliflower is because it was around Christmas. They slashed the price for carrots, parsnips and other vegs over Christmas although throughout the year, groceries are cheap in UK compared to Singapore. This is mainly due to the fact that there is farming in UK and we do not have to import everything. Public transport is expensive as you said.

I would usually select the latest time slot (until 9pm) as I’m out all day on weekdays. How does it work in Singapore if the delivery arrives when you are not home? My colleague told me I would have to pick it up at the closest post office but that wouldn’t be practical for bulky items. Thanks!,,

The staff depend on the agencies to provide them visas, employment, money which goes back to their homes in Thailand/Indonesia/Philippines/China etc & just $1 dollar means a lot to them. Every holiday or special celebration we'll give our cleaner a present & when we've clothes we dont want anymore, we give them first pick and usually they'll send a large majority to their family back home.

I feel like the law on nudity at home is there for cases whereby individuals deliberately expose themselves, or when there is an inconsiderate individual who chooses to be in front of a window naked despite maybe there being kids? Honestly some of these laws do sound a little ridiculous to me as a local but I do believe policemen or officers do use their discretion to judge a situation and not just blindly follow the book. The laws that really get on my nerves are the laws against suicide and homosexuality- which are rarely enforced too, but the fact that they still exist say something about our culture, and these laws feel like a violation of rights tbh.

Because of the nature of the rule, it is extremely hard to be prosecuted for this due to the fact that it is extremely hard to catch and arrest anyone that is having gay sex. There have been one or two people charged with it, but i don’t think there have been anyone that has actually been found guilty for this. The rule is actually quite loose, and used as a deterrent for any sort of male homosexual behaviour. Because people rarely actively seek out the terms and conditions of this law, they tend to stray away from any sort of homosexual behaviour due to fear of being arrested and charged.",2,View reply

EXPAT LIVING IN SINGAPORE | UPDATE,darrendelong,4 years ago,"Singlish is basically a mix of broken English and local dialects such as Malay, Tamil and Chinese dialects (usually not Mandarin). 

Well, Lah is NOT exactly used at the end of all sentences. It really depends. It's can be used when you want to put an emphasis to your statement. Lah is not used when you are asking a question. For example, if you wanna say ""I am going!"", you can say ""I am going lah"".  2nd eg. ""Oh, come on!"", you can say ""Come on lah"", ""Oh please, don't do it"" becomes ""Please lah, don't do it leh"". Leh in this context becomes like a request.

I live in Singapore and Singlish is a really difficult to understand by foreigners 😂 it's kind of our language it's difficult to explain what it means but I'm pretty sure you'll get used to it 👌🏻 also I think you find the air con unbearable because in Singapore its burning so Malls tend to turn down the air con because it's so hot and we're used to it :) Singapore has a lot of sightseeing places and small streets which are amazing. I suggest haji lane if you have like a photo taking day because it's so photo worthy 👌🏻 there's cafes there too and usually on weekend nights they have a little flea with a lot of food and performances. I personally have never been there at night but I've been there for photoshoots and it's pretty cool ☺️ cafe hopping is pretty popular and one of the cafes you should try is the cat cafe at Victoria street.

That might be the watery one you're talking about. It might be nice if you've grown up eating it, but the flavour isn't that strong so I don't really like it. I usually ask for fish curry, because it has that tomato-based sardine flavour which makes it a bit tangy and super delicious. Otherwise, mutton curry if fish curry isn't available because like Jade says, it's usually a bit thicker and flavourful.",,View 2 replies from Georgia Caney and others

SINGAPORE ENGLISH VS BRITISH ENGLISH (Ft. Noah Yap),Guess Who,1 month ago,"It sounds like Singlish relies on a lot of assumed meanings, which is typical of a 'simplified' language, whereas in regular English everything has to be said very clearly or else meaning is lost without the required context. 'On the light' is a good example; in Singapore one assumes the meaning to be an instruction to turn on the light because that is the assumed context based on colloquial usage of the term. Whereas in the UK where we make fewer assumptions the lack of the verb 'turn' completely changes the context of the phrase; we would think the person is trying to say there is something physically on top of the light, rather than the person wanting us to activate it.",,

FOREIGNER LEARNS TO SPEAK CHINESE (MANDARIN) | PHONETICS & GREETINGS,didumdum,2 years ago,"Thank you in Chinese is by right, phonetically written (and hence pronounced) with the 's' sound. But to sound more ""native"" and ""modern"", it is usually pronounced with a slight ""sh"" sound too. The ""sh"" sound is light, and not as strong as how ""sh"" is pronounced in English. It is kind of like a difference in accent though, so there are many Chinese who would say it with the ""s"" sound and not the ""sh"" sound too.",1,View 2 replies from Georgia Caney and others

Foreigners First Time In Geylang! 🇸🇬,Meifern Lee,1 year ago (edited),"The word Geylang is found early in Singapore's history and also in early topographical maps showing marsh and coconut plantations beside and adjacent to the mouth of the Kallang River, home to the Orang Laut (sea gypsies). One possible etymological link in the stock vocabulary of the Malay is 'geylanggan' meaning to 'twist' or 'crush' a reference to the process of extracting the coconut meat and milk used by the locals to thicken curries in Malay-Chinese (Peranakan) cuisine. The idea persists to this day, of the process of heartache and desperation associated with the broken and hurting lives of those involved in buying and selling of sex and drugs on the streets and in the registered brothel in the area. The word Geylang may be derived from a corrupted spelling of the Malay word 'gelang' which is a type of edible creeper (Portulaca oleracea). This is a more plausible explanation for the name because Malays typically name places based on the abundance of certain plant species (e.g. Melaka after the tree species of the same name) or geological formations (e.g. Bukit Gombak based on the comb-like hill summit.",14,View reply

The Truth About Why It's So Hard For Foreigners To Leave Singapore,David Ng,1 day ago,"I am bias for cooler weather because I associate it with vacations but my longest time away in cooler weather was just 6 weeks in Europe late summer/early fall and for 3 weeks during winters. I think what makes the European weather amazing is that you can sit on the grass outside and get some sun in summer without sweating. It encourages people to get out and be around nature and be active. In winter, the SAD from a lack of Vit D and isolation can be combated by meeting friends over a hot chocolate drink. It incentivizes meeting people and entering a restaurant, pub or even home is like a big warm hug that envelopes you. I think tropical people also have reason to romanticize seasonal weather because like changing curtains or rearranging furniture, the weather changes seasonally to keep things fresh. By the time you get bored of the current weather, a new season arrives and with it comes its foods, activities and colours that force you to adapt to it.",2,

MY SHOCK PCOS DIAGNOSIS | HEALTH UPDATE,essy,2 years ago,"Hey Georgia, your symptoms of extreme period pain sounds absolutely terrible. I can't even imagine having it so bad to the point of passing out. My best friend was diagnosed with PCOS a year or two ago and she always had issues with irregular periods in the past. It eventually got worse and she started to show signs of PCOS mostly irregular periods, increased body hair but her head hair was thinning & mood changes, she was lucky enough not to have severe period pain. She decided to try out the natural medicine route and with the help of her naturopath and diet change she was able to decrease / cure it and no longer suffers from the PCOS symptoms. Although I believe it did take a while for change to happen she stuck to her herbs and it worked. Your cramps sound unbearable but I think it's worth a shot to try the natural medicine or TCM route especially since you already seem to not want to put more strong hormone altering western meds in your body. A lot of doctors just prescribe medicines to mask the pain whereas a good naturopath is focused on finding the route cause and fixing it - although sometimes it does take trial and error. If the natural route doesn't work for you then you can always try western medicine. I'm sure there are many videos and knowledge on youtube about naturally curing PCOS if you haven't already watched them. Good luck and keep us updated xx",2,

But when you factor in that people tend to think of what is familiar as 'low-class' and certain other words as fancier/atas, what happens is you get a skewed idea of what is common here. For example, I'm pretty sure people are more familiar with the word, 'toilet', but because we're so familiar with it, we think of it as the low-class/commoner way of saying it, while 'washroom' is the more polite/atas way of saying it. Same with 'lift'.",41,

Weird Habits We've Adopted Living In Singapore! 🇸🇬 Expat Life,Ordinary Observer,8 months ago,"🤣I was tickled when you talked about changing lane. I learnt that from a taxi driver and so true, else you can""t get into the other lane easily especially if it is the first lane.
On leaving laptops and phones alone, I feel that it is not always safe here. Depends on where you are. I once dropped my mobile phone in a coffee shop. When I realized it within a minute and walked back it was gone. The person standing at the stall said she didnt see any hand phone on the floor.😭 Lesson learnt. The taxi drivers here are well trained to be honest.",,

I've been watching your videos and they've been very helpful. Thank you. 
I am in a similar situation to what you had two years ago. But I'm struggling to find a way to move to Singapore with my boyfriend, who has been offered a job there. Apologies in advance if I missed anything in your videos but from what I do remember, you mentioned that you didn't have an EP or a DP. I went to the Singapore High Commission in London and the options open to me are quite bleak. Could you please let me know what pass/visa you used to move to Singapore? Your answer would really help me out so much. Thank you :)",2,

However, the actual proposal was a surprise and I didn't expect it at all.

When I was living in Singapore more than a decade ago I thought there's nothing wrong with customer service here, but when I moved to the UK i realised, customer service in singapore didn't tend to offer alternative solution. So, if it can't be done then it can't be done, end of conversation. Whereas in the UK, if it can't be done one way, they would normally offer another way. I also know someone who worked in customer service in Singapore, one of the big telco companies, when a customer wanted to escalate, and asked to speak with the manager, he just passed it on to his colleague right next to him who wasn't a manager at all.",,View reply from Georgia Caney

Interesting fact of Kampong glam: (from culture trip website) 
The history of Kampong Glam can be traced back to the 1820s when it was first named. The name comes from the Malay language where kampung means ‘village’ and ‘gelam’ was a type of tree known as the Paperbark tree that grew in the area and was frequently used for building ships. For a long time, Kampong Glam was a fishing village due to its location on the Rochor River. In 1820s, Sir Stamford Raffles designated the Kampong Glam as well as an annual stipend to Sultan Hussain Mohammed Shah for use by the Muslim community after he signed a treaty ceding Singapore to the East India Company.",10,

The English educated and Chinese educated. My mum was in the Chinese educated side. And back then, the Chinese educated were looked down upon. Their classes were not as well equipped as the other classes and they were not allowed to mingle with other students. At times, they did not even have classrooms and have to have classes along the hallway. The plaza used to be sunken in and was a field where they did their P.E.. When the govt decided to move all schools out of the city center, the school then became into two different schools. One is CHIJ St. Nicholas Girls' School (Chinese Ed), and CHIJ Toa Payoh(English Ed).",10,View 3 replies

COME RUNNING WITH ME IN SINGAPORE!💦 7k Marina Bay Run,Mark Iversen,11 months ago (edited),"Your best video yet.  That's just me though.  I run 75% of my runs around Bishan Park to Peirce Reservoir and to MacRitchie Reservoir as well.  But I also run East Coast Park through Gardens by the Bay the other 25% of the time. And then when I am not in Singapore, I have run a lot of different places, mostly in the USA and in Switzerland a couple of times.  Well done though.  I would keep your goal at finishing under one hour and enjoy it.  That will keep you coming back for another run. Happy Running.",,View reply from Georgia Caney

"THE COST OF LIVING IN SINGAPORE! 🇸🇬 RENT, PUBLIC TRANSPORT, GROCERIES + MORE!",Piotr,10 months ago,"Fitness First is around $200/month they have the most locations but are overcrowded, then there's Pure (I had a pre-opening deal) $130/month (not sure how much more is their normal pricing) - hands down my favorite gym in Singapore but much fewer locations. Anytime Fitness is worthless if you're living in a good condo - their gyms are the size of a condo gym. Then there are specialty gyms - like True Yoga - I used to do Bikram there for around $120/4 classes/month. Or martial arts, like Evolve - now that's expensive $330-400/month but totally worth it. This is my 7th country and in general gyms are more expensive than pretty much anywhere I've been living before, maybe on par with Scandinavia. But I do agree that it's waaaay cheaper to live in Singapore than pretty much any other big city I've lived in before. The high cost of rent (not that high if someone lived in NY or London) is more than evened out by the affordability of food, low cost of transportation etc. I haven't cooked in 6 years - I would not be able to afford that anywhere else I've lived so far. The myth of Singapore being so expensive comes from the fact these comparison studies have a standard basket of goods and they check the prices of these items everywhere. If you want to live like you did in US or UK, eat the same stuff and do the same type of activities why even bother to leave your country?",7,

Not a fan of ezbuy and cheap clothes, not because it's cheap (everyone loves a good deal)  but because most of these fast fashion clothing are possibly made in inhumane working environments, like a sweat shop. The reason why it is priced the way it is is because of the low paying labour and bad working conditions of the workers making these clothing at factories. Would love to hear different opinions on this.",10,

A Typical Week Living In Singapore VLOG! Hiking + CNY Celebrations,Seb,8 months ago,"From my air-con experience, mine had condensation at the pipes due to the air-con being set at a low fan speed and it kinda caused a stain on the walls. Air-con company advise us to set the air-con to medium fan speed and it fixed the problem. Another thing possible reason is the coil in the air-con could be stuffed with dirt so it's time for chemical cleaning. Normally air-cons need chemical cleaning once a year, and general servicing every 3 months. Too much chemical cleaning will cause the metal parts inside the air-con to corrode faster.",1,View reply from Georgia Caney

This was the first (and only) bit of furniture that I gave a 'shabby chic' makeover to so I hadn't the slightest idea about priming, varnishing, or the correct ways to go about it. I literally just dived in and coated it in paint with some sanding. 2 Years later it's still in my bedroom and in exactly the same condition so for people to slate how I went about it the wrong way constantly just blows my mind. It was for MY room and a little project for myself so in no way am I a shabby chic guru, I just made it all up! If people know how to do it properly, good for them!

EXPAT TIPS FOR MOVING TO SINGAPORE!,AaainDee,3 years ago (edited),"Singaporeans generally will not stop to help if someone is already helping (in non-threatening situations). I'm Singaporean and it has happened to me before. Not even my friends stopped to help, I was the only one as others watched. I think it's mainly because we are reserved and are afraid/shy (?) of the attention given. We would usually try not to look or stare because it's considered rude. That's probably why when they saw you helping that boy, they looked away. For me personally, I would prefer if less people helped me because that would mean that less attention is on me hence, less embarrassment. Hope that makes sense.

BEING A TOURIST IN SINGAPORE IS EXPENSIVE! 💵 WEEKLY VLOG,eLtitude,1 year ago (edited),"here's what I've learned to do to get rid of stitches as you get them on the fly. apply immense pressure on the area of pain, likely under the diaphragm and with ONE huge deep puff, breathe out, should almost sound like you're saying HEEEEWWWWWWW when you deep breathe out. takes away 60-70% of the stitch almost immediately. rest of it either bleeds out or (less likely, but it happens) starts to build up agn and at tht point, simply rinse and repeat. practice 3-5 times and you'll be able to get the technique and desired effect down. eventually, you'll learn to perform it while running. a stitch is an acute pain caused by an air bubble building up over time under the diaphragm and gets trapped, it takes a while to get rid of naturally by waiting it out or without physical ""intervention"" , so to avoid it, breath control is key. its important then to be conscious when breathing in, essentially do less of it. for me, I breathe in as I would normally on a run, maybe a touch less even, but I then take double short to medium breaths out, generally helps exhale more air out than I normally do, we're trying as much as possible to match the air outtake with the intake and what the technique aims to achieve is to squeeze tht air bubble out of the diaphragm in a single breath. on an unrelated note, run outside! if you can get over the mugginess, sg's just a lovely place to be running outside, you'd hardly notice the distance as much with the changing scenery.",3,

Use any mascara you like, and brush this fixer through where you tend to smudge (or all over you lashes if you touch them a lot, or want to completely waterproof them)!! Or you can use it before applying the mascara! Let’s you use any mascara you desire, while making it completely budge-proof!! You’ll need an oil-based cleanser to remove this though!

I guess that's just a cultural difference? Would personally appreciate it more if my group is left alone rather than constantly being interrupted. Even things like ""How's the meal"", etc etc can be distracting. If it's good, we'd tell them after we're done. If there's room for improvement, it can also be said before leaving.

What NOT to do as a FOREIGNER in Singapore! 🇸🇬,Stephen Vincent,1 year ago,"Singapore customer service seems to depend on the establishment you’re in. Workers in many stores appear to rely on sales commissions of some sort, so are more attentive (sometimes overly so). Most eating establishments don’t work this way so the service is less attentive. It also very much depends on what you’re used to and your own demeanour and attitude. If you’re civil to people, most will be civil in return. Of course there are always exceptions and we all have bad days.",4,View reply

Let's be honest some of the things here already cheap compared to other developed countries. Those in the lower rung of society are not well-paid here, especially those Hawker Centre assistants.

Weirdest Questions We Have Been Asked In Singapore! 🇸🇬 Expat Life,Fanah Evans,1 year ago,"""Have you eaten?"" is basically a Singaporean way of asking how are you and opening up a conversation with you to other things. Its actually really common everywhere in the workplace even with colleagues I don't speak to much. The question about ""How long are you staying here?"" is because in some companies we don't get many foreigners joining us so it's also really just out of curiosity, they're not shooing you out. The spice thing though, Singaporeans just generally ask out of concern because we don't want our colleagues to accidentally eat spicy food because we don't know if they can handle spice the way we can. And about the accents, not many of us are exposed to colleagues from US, UK or Australia and I guess that's why the first thing they ask is always ""Are you American?"". Many of them don't ask out of being rude but really just curiosity because they really don't know and they'd like to know more about you.",9,View reply from Georgia Caney

Weirdest Questions We Have Been Asked In Singapore! 🇸🇬 Expat Life,Patrick Tay,1 year ago,"Apart from relatives, my friends and other acquaintances have never ask me my age, or how much I get paid. Well, extremely close friends maybe, but I always dodge the question and not tell. As for ""have you eaten"", it originated from back when our Chinese ancestors were still in China. In those days, people were generally poor and food was a scarcity. It was a question directed mainly to the children, with the intention of sharing some food with them if they have not eaten. Back then, they have the mentality of ""adults can go hungry, but children should not"". As lives get better, the question was directed to adults as well. It was seen as a form of prosperity to be able to treat someone to a meal. Present day, it's just an question in passing. That is why no one ever followup with ""What have you eaten"". Yet, if you answered ""no"" to that question, you may get an invitation to a meal like ""Shall we go this place for lunch then?"". Do note that it may not be a ""treat"", and you may have to pay for your own share. It could be just someone who doesn't want to eat alone and asking for companionship. Interestingly, the other races also picked up this question from the Chinese and may ask you the same question.",5,View reply from Georgia Caney

Weirdest Questions We Have Been Asked In Singapore! 🇸🇬 Expat Life,A Low,1 year ago,"hello! it actually is rude to ask about age (although moreso for the ladies) and salary here too. it's more that you guys obviously look like foreigners, so people probably tend to forget the same social rules apply. My guess would be that the age question stems from the fact that westerners tend to mature/age faster than asians, so it's always a little freaky/disconcerting/fascinating to find out someone is a lot younger than they look. The salary question probably stems from the fact that you guys look like expats (specifically western expats rather than asian expats), and it's interesting to know how much you make because of how there seems to be a stratification of lifestyle/income/class between foreigners and locals - of course it's a generalisation and not all western expats are CEOs/COOs for huge MNCs, but that's just the perception. Anyway, these would otherwise be rude/sensitive questions that we wouldn't ask each other unless we were closer friends (definitely not strangers). The thing about you guys being mini-celebrities and getting people wanting to take selfies stems from colonial history/pre-globalisation, where most of the westerners we and our parents saw were from the upper class who could afford to travel, or celebrities on tv and in movies, so it's subconscious ingrained that westerners are superior. Of course, as time goes by, this pre-globalisation mindset will fade. The thing about 'have you eaten' stems from world war II days, where our grandparents would struggle to have their stomachs filled, so asking 'have you eaten' is a show of concern (something like 'how are you') - if you have eaten, that means you were doing well. I'm guessing you'd get it from baby boomers (children of those who went through the war), who probably picked it up from their parents. If you get it from anyone younger, it's probably they picked it up from their parents/grandparents, or we're using it actually like a conversation starter (rather than a 'how are you'), because food is a pretty big part of Singapore culture. I'd sometimes ask people if they've eaten just to get food ideas for my next meal.",2,

I eventually found my way to the entrance and toured the grounds.

I've since come to the believe that the Asian custom of openness in salary discussions is more helpful to the workers to get fair pay. The personnel department goes to great lengths to hire research firms to gather market data on all salaries for each job position. With the information in hand, they make sure they never overpay.
