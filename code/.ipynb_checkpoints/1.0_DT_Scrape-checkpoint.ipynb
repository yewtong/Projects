    "### Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In a world still battling the spread of Covid-19, countries around the world have shut down their borders. In the wake of a devastating loss in tourism dollars, government bodies and organisations announced the launch of the [SingapoRediscovers](https://www.stb.gov.sg/content/stb/en/media-centre/media-releases/Enterprise-Singapore-Sentosa-Development-Corporation-and-Singapore-Tourism-Board-team-up-with-industry-to-encourage-locals-to-rediscover-Singapore.html.html) campaign on 22nd July 2020 and set aside 45 million dollars to boost domestic tourism. However, a new initiative in the form of SingapoRediscovers vouchers was announced less than a month later. This new initiative comes with a budget of 320 million dollars and aim to distribute [\\$100 tourism vouchers](https://www.stb.gov.sg/content/stb/en/media-centre/media-releases/SingapoRediscovers-and-Expanded-Attractions-Guidelines.html) to all Singaporeans aged 18 and above valid for seven months from December 2020 to end-June 2021.\n",
    "\n",
    "With so much stimulus dollars planned to revive our hardest-hit industry, just what exactly is domestic tourism? If you give it further thought, it is a concept that is at first glance paradoxical - can you still be a tourist back home? But, if you were to ask around, it seems most everyone has an idea on what domestic tourism is. As soon as word about the $100 tourism vouchers began circulating, everyone began planning their next staycation or a trip to the USS. Is that all there is to domestic tourism, or is there more? Can we actually grow and sustain domestic tourism in Singapore simply by incentivising local Singaporeans to participate in activities that are otherwise usually targetted at foreign visitors? How can we best encourage Singaporeans to go out and explore this home of theirs, and to be tourists at home?\n",
    "\n",
    "Representing STB, this project aims to uncover the Singaporeans' perception of domestic tourism, and to identify key areas of high potential where we can focus our efforts for the next phase of the #SingapoRediscovers campaign. To do this, the project hypothesises that:\n",
    "\n",
    "> the number of likes attracted by a post/video/comment is indicative of the support and popularity behind the tourism idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "By training our model to predict on the popularity of a video/post, the model learns to rate the attractiveness/reception of a certain idea proposition. The initial direction of the project was therefore to predict on the number of likes and solve a regression problem. For reasons we will elucidate later, this was subsequently adapted into a classification problem where we predict on the popularity of the content. Nonetheless, the number of likes remains a useful data point to scrape as we would be engineering our labels for popularity from each data point's number of likes.\n",
    "\n",
    "After training, we can then infer from the trained model and identify opportunities of high potential for the next phase of the #SingapoRediscovers campaign. Through this, my project hopes to gather enough insight to propose recommendations for the next phase of the campaign. To begin building a model up to the task, we have to first gather data. In order to access and interpret the on-the-ground sentiment and perception of domestic tourism, this project aims to scrape strategically both Instagram and YouTube for data. This notebook compiles the script for the scraping endeavours."

    "### Scrape Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to provide actionable insights for STB to focus on for the next phase of their campaign, and to provide a vision of tourism in the new normal, this project hypothesises that the number of likes attracted by a post/video/comment is indicative of the support and enthusiasm behind the tourism idea. The scraping process begins with a few key assumptions that underlie my hypotheses. They are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Instagram posts can reveal the **conscious local perception** of domestic tourism made explicit by through hashtagging.\n",
    "- YouTube videos and comments make up a dialogue that can reveal the **unconscious local perception** of domestic tourism made implicit by local recommendations on exploring Singapore in reaction to the video.\n",
    "- Locals would follow through on their own recommendations for others.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also assumptions that belie my sampling methodology. I will split the assumptions up according to platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For Instagram:**\n",
    "- Posts that make use of the target hashtags are perceived by the owner account to match the idea behind the hashtag and are useful to understanding local perception of domestic tourism.\n",
    "- Posts attract likes based on viewers' support of and agreement with the content matching their hashtags.\n",
    "- Comments on posts are mostly supportive in nature and not useful to furthering our understanding of the ideas behind the hashtags.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For YouTube:**\n",
    "- Transient vloggers on YouTube with a travel video on Singapore attract mostly overseas commenters, whom while generally supportive and enthusiastic about Singapore, are unable to offer further insights into exploring Singapore.\n",
    "- While local YouTubers attract local followers/commenters, their commenters refrain from providing recommendations as their local status means that they are already perceived as subject matter experts.\n",
    "- Foreign YouTubers based in Singapore achieves the fine balance of attracting local followers/commenters, while providing a conducive comment space for dialogue between video content on exploring Singapore and local recommendations on where else to check out."

    "We are done scraping for Instagram! A total of 7 target hashtags were queried and scraped.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instagram was scraped according to hashtags to uncover people's (predominantly local) perception/sentiment of what it means to be a tourist in Singapore as a local. Following the scrape of the campaign's official hashtag #SingapoRediscovers, other relevant hashtags were targetted. These hashtags were chosen for their pertinence to the current and evolving situation of domestic tourism in Covid-19's new normal. While there are numerous hashtags about the exploration of Singapore, this project targetted only those posts that were created in reaction to the idea of domestic tourism in this new normal.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, #rediscoversg or #rediscoversingapore were chosen over #discoversingapore even though the latter had over 110,000 posts at the time of the scrape. However, much of this were surmised to be less relevant noise as they do not capture the rediscovering spirit as prompted by the #SingapoRediscovers campaign and are also widely used by tourists from pre-Covid times. It is assumed that owing to current travel restrictions, the #rediscoversg and #rediscoversingapore hashtags were used in posts that are more current and by locals who are in Singapore.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another official campaign's hashtag launched adjacent to #SingapoRediscovers by STB and other agencies to encourage locals' holiday-making in Singapore is #Singapoliday. Some instagram posts were misspelt and tagged as #singaporeliday instead. Both these hashtags were targetted for scraping.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, another predominant hashtag in this period of time picked up while researching is #madaboutsingapore2020 and its misspelt cousin #madaboutsingapore2020c. While there is a more widely used #madaboutsingapore hashtag with over 80,000 posts tagged to it, #madaboutsingapore2020(c) were chosen for its recent birth in this new normal that again captured the rediscovering spirit as exhorted by STB. Both these hashtags were similarly targetted for scraping."
